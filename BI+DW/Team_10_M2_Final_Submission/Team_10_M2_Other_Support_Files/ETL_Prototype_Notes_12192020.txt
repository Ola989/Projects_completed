Steps for performing ETL on the Dealer Dim

Based on the mapping spreadsheet, we decided to extract the Dealer table from the Products and Sales Org
database, and the Owner_Address, Independent, Corporate, Branch, and Website tables from the 
Corporate database

1. Drop / recreate Dealer staging table from Products
2. Drop / recreate Dealer staging table from Sales_Org
3. Drop / recreate Owner_Address staging table from Corporate
4. Drop / recreate Independent staging table from Corporate
5. Drop / recreate Corporate staging table from Corporate
6. Drop / recreate Branch staging table from Corporate
7. Drop / recreate Website staging table from Corporate
6. Drop / recreate View Extract_Product_Dealer before staging
7. Drop / recreate View Extract_SalesOrg_Dealer before staging
8. Drop / recreate View Extract_Corporate_Owner_Address before staging
9. Drop / recreate View Extract_Corporate_Branch before staging
10. Drop / recreate View Extract_Corporate_Independent before staging
11. Drop / recreate View Extract_Corporate_Corporate before staging
12. Drop / recreate View Extract_Corporate_Website before staging
13. Extract from OLTP(Corporate) and load into the staging table
14. Extract from OLTP(Corporate) and load into the staging table
15. Drop and recreate view to join the 7 staged tables together
16. Extract from the view and load into the Dealer DIM in the star schema
